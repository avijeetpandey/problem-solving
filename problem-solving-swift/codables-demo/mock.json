The country's chefs have taken many of the traditionally Western desserts known and loved around the world and elevated them to new heights.\n\nUnlike Japanese sweets -- called wagashi -- Western-style confectioneries, referred to as yogashi, are made mostly of flour and sugar. But Japanese versions are generally less sweet compared to their Western counterparts."
